/// Private helper struct for implementing the line-buffered writing logic.

/// This shim temporarily wraps a BufWriter, and uses its internals to
/// implement a line-buffered writer (specifically by using the internal
/// methods like write_to_buf and flush_buf). In this way, a more
/// efficient abstraction can be created than one that only had access to
/// `write` and `flush`, without needlessly duplicating a lot of the
/// implementation details of BufWriter. This also allows existing
/// `BufWriters` to be temporarily given line-buffering logic; this is what
/// enables Stdout to be alternately in line-buffered or block-buffered mode.
